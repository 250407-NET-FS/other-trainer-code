A mix of multiple choice and short answer questions. We take our quizzes on RevPro. 

### Camera Policy

Our clients expect candidates that are fully present. While we are working from home, this means being engaged 
with our cameras turned on. With that said, here are the expectations surrounding cameras during training:

* I will require you to have cameras on when I ask.
* Cameras should always be on during:
  * QC
  * While taking quizzes
  * 1-on-1 meetings
  * Any time another Revature employee comes in to give a presentation
  * During project presentations
  * And more...
  
### Attendance Policy

Your trainer tracks attendance daily. Some things to note:

* If you think you will be absent or tardy, just let me know with ideally 24 hours or more notice if possible.
* If I excuse your tardiness or absence, then it will not count against you.
* Excessive unexcused tardiness or absences will have consequences up to and including release from the program.
